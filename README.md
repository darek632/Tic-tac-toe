# Tic-tac-toe

Come back to update display and evaluation for next time. 
Still to do: 
- Button to reset the game
- improve the look of Grid
- Use X and O graphics or improve their UI (bigger, different colour, fitting the cell more)
- Display player 1 and player 2 markers and scores, with these updating when each is won.
- update the whose-turn to just say 'plaeyr1 turn' as the marker will already be displayed.
- Bonus pooint for asking the user what their name is using dialog modal
